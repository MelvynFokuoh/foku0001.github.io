        <article>About Me</article>
        <p>My name is <em>Melvyn Fokuoh.</em> I'm a screenwriter and an aspiring web developer. I joined this program initially for design, but I have already pivoted towards programming. It has so far been my favourite course in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program and I'm hoping to learn more and advance my skills. I'm aiming to do some self-learning on the side as well.</p>
        <p>At first I was wondering why I was instantly drawn to programming in week one, then I realized it was one of the same reasons I love screenwriting: <sup>the creation of a blueprint.</sup> As a screenwriter, many people are surprised that I don't like any other type of writing other than screenwriting and songwriting. These forms of writing are essentially a blueprint of text before they are consumed by others in a visual and/or sonic form.</p>
